Overall Concept
1. Root Node (User Prompt)
    * The user begins by typing a prompt (e.g., “Design the interface for a 1000-floor elevator”).
    * This prompt becomes the root node on the Main Canvas, the trunk of a tree from which all subsequent branches (questions) extend.
2. AI-Powered Question Generation (via gpt-4-0125-preview)
    * After initial preferences (e.g., conflict and unknown handling) are set, the AI dynamically generates follow-up questions.
    * It references prior answers and any uploaded knowledge base (elevator guidelines, building specs) to decide which child nodes (sub-branches) to create.
    * Early questions are intentionally basic—“Is the elevator primarily for humans or for machinery?”—to clarify fundamental requirements before diving deeper.
3. Breadth-First or Depth-First Q&A
    * The user chooses one of two traversal modes (matching your diagrams):
        1. Breadth-First: The system completes all siblings at the current “layer” (as in layer 1 → layer 2 → layer 3 in your BFS image) before revealing children of those siblings.
        2. Depth-First: The system immediately drills down into child nodes of the just-answered question (as in your DFS image), postponing siblings until that branch is fully explored.
    * Sequential Question Generation:
        * In either mode, only one question is shown at a time, and a new question (sibling or child) appears only after the user answers the current question.
    * Pruning & Conflict Resolution: If an updated answer invalidates certain paths, the AI prunes them. It may silently fix minor conflicts if auto-resolve is on.
4. On-Demand Generation
    * Single Path to Generate: At any time, the user can click “Generate” to produce a partial or full mockup and requirements doc based on all answers so far.
    * Filling Gaps: If the user has unanswered questions, the system either:
        * Guesses (if trivial unknown auto-mode is on), or
        * Leaves placeholders / annotated TODOs for major unknowns.
    * Requirements & Mockup Availability: The system compiles a requirements doc and produces React/Tailwind code whenever requested—no need to wait for all questions to be answered.
    * Version Browsing & Restoration: Each generation is saved as a version the user can preview later, restore the Q&A tree to that state, or compare changes over time.

Step 1: Initial Setup & Prompt Node
1. Enter the Prompt
    * The user types: “Design the interface for a 1000-floor elevator.”
    * Labeled on the Main Canvas as “Prompt: 1000-floor elevator” (the root node).
2. Optional Knowledge Base Upload
    * If the user uploads relevant documents (e.g., building specs), the AI may auto-populate answers it’s confident about.
    * No knowledge base = no auto-populate.
3. Unknown & Conflict Handling (AI Settings)
    * Unknowns:
        * Auto (trivial) – The AI guesses minor data gaps (like kiosk color).
        * Always prompt – The user explicitly addresses each unknown; major unknowns (like compliance codes) always need confirmation.
    * Conflicts:
        * Auto-resolve minor – The AI quietly fixes small contradictions.
        * Manual resolution – All conflicts appear in the Q&A Panel; major ones always prompt the user.
4. Breadth-First or Depth-First Q&A Selection
    * Breadth-First: Complete all top-level siblings (like Q1, Q2, Q3 in BFS image) before showing their children.
    * Depth-First: As soon as Q1 is answered, show Q1’s children, postponing Q2 and Q3 until Q1’s subtree is done (like DFS image).
5. Once these settings are confirmed, the root node is finalized.

Step 2: Interactive Q&A Flow (AI-Driven)
2.1. The Root Node & First Questions
* Main Canvas: Displays the root node (the user’s prompt).
* Right-Hand Q&A Panel: “Begin Q&A” triggers gpt-4-0125-preview.
* AI Question Generation:
    * The AI spawns the first top-level questions (Q1, Q2, Q3), referencing the prompt/knowledge base.
    * For example:
        * Q1: “Is the elevator primarily for humans or machinery?”
        * Q2: “What is the total number of floors?”
        * Q3: “Any known budget constraints?”
2.2. Q&A Progression (Breadth vs. Depth)

2.2.1. One Question at a Time
* The system only generates the next question after the user answers the current one
* New questions (whether siblings or children) appear sequentially, never simultaneously

2.2. Q&A Progression (Breadth vs. Depth)

2.2.1. One Question at a Time
* System shows exactly one question at a time
* Next question appears only after current question is answered
* All questions come sequentially, regardless of mode

2.2.2. Breadth-First Mode (Layer-by-Layer)
1. Traversal Pattern:
   Layer 0 (Root):
   * Q0: "Design elevator interface" (Initial Prompt)
   
   Layer 1 (Main Topics):
   * Q1: "What is the maximum load capacity?"
   * Q2: "How will users input floor numbers?"
   * Q3: "What safety features are required?"
   * Complete ALL Layer 1 before going deeper
   
   Layer 2 (Topic Details):
   * Under Load Capacity (Q1):
     - Q4: "How will capacity be monitored?"
     - Q5: "What alerts for overload?"
   * Under Floor Input (Q2):
     - Q6: "Keypad layout preferences?"
     - Q7: "Screen display needs?"
   * Under Safety Features (Q3):
     - Q8: "Emergency protocols?"
     - Q9: "Security requirements?"
   * Complete ALL Layer 2 before proceeding
   
   Layer 3 (Specific Features):
   * Under Capacity Monitoring (Q4):
     - Q10: "Visual indicator type?"
     - Q11: "Sensor placement?"
   * Under Overload Alerts (Q5):
     - Q12: "Audio warning system?"
     - Q13: "Visual warning display?"
   * (Similar branching for Q6-Q9)
   * Process continues for any number of layers

2. Key BFS Characteristics
   * Completes each entire layer before going deeper
   * All related questions at same depth are handled together
   * Questions numbered sequentially within layers
   * Example: All monitoring systems before exploring specific alert types

2.2.3. Depth-First Mode (Complete Topics)
1. Traversal Pattern:
   Start (Root):
   * Q0: "Design elevator interface" (Initial Prompt)
   
   Load Capacity Branch:
   * Q1: "What is the maximum load capacity?"
      * Q2: "How will capacity be monitored?"
         * Q3: "Visual indicator type?"
         * Q4: "Sensor placement?"
      * Q5: "What alerts for overload?"
         * Q6: "Audio warning system?"
         * Q7: "Visual warning display?"
   
   Floor Input Branch (only after completing Load Capacity):
   * Q8: "How will users input floor numbers?"
      * Q9: "Keypad layout preferences?"
         * Q10: "Button arrangement?"
         * Q11: "Tactile feedback?"
      * (Continues exploring all interface aspects)

2. Key DFS Characteristics
   * Fully explores each topic before moving to next
   * Questions numbered in exact exploration order
   * Can go arbitrarily deep in any branch
   * Example: Complete all capacity monitoring features before touching floor input

Key Differences:
1. Question Order:
   * BFS: Handles all topics at one depth (Q1,Q2,Q3) before going deeper
   * DFS: Completes one topic entirely before moving to next

2. Numbering:
   * BFS: Sequential within layers (Q0 → Q1,Q2,Q3 → Q4,Q5,Q6,Q7,Q8,Q9 → Q10,Q11,Q12,Q13)
   * DFS: Based on exploration order (Q0 → Q1 → Q2 → Q3,Q4 → Q5 → Q6,Q7 → Q8)

3. Topic Coverage:
   * BFS: Broad overview of all topics first, then details
   * DFS: Complete topic details before new topics
2.2.4. New Top-Level Branches
* The AI can discover (or user can request) a new major domain mid-flow.
* Three ways new top-level Q’s appear:
    1. User-Initiated: “What about elevator signage?”
    2. AI-Detected: The AI sees advanced security is needed.
    3. Post-Completion: A final check after all known Q’s.
* By default, these new top-level Q’s remain queued until the user completes the current BFS layer or DFS branch—unless flagged urgent.

2.3. Conflict & Unknown Resolution (AI Assistance)
1. Conflict Detection
    * Each new answer is checked against previous answers and knowledge-base data.
2. Minor Conflicts (Auto-Resolve)
    * Trivial inconsistencies (e.g., color mismatch) are silently fixed if auto-resolve is on.
3. Major Conflicts (Always Prompt)
    * If fundamental (e.g., code compliance), the system asks the user to reconcile.
    * Example: “Floors above 500 need advanced voice commands, but voice hardware is disallowed.”
4. Unknown Fields
    * Trivial Unknown (Auto): AI guesses, labeling it “AI-guessed.”
    * Major Unknown: The user must confirm. No children appear until it’s resolved.
    * “Always prompt” means the user addresses all unknowns manually.

2.4. Revisiting & Editing Answers
* Clicking an Answered Node
    * The user can revisit Q2, changing its answer. The system re-checks Q2’s children for validity.
* Pruning & Replacement
    * If a new answer invalidates existing children, those sub-branches are pruned. If the new logic calls for different questions, they appear.
* Cross-Branch Conflicts
    * If changing Q2 conflicts with Q7 in another branch, the system either auto-fixes (if minor) or prompts for user choice (if major).

2.5. User-Initiated Topics
    * The user can say, “Give me more detail on accessibility,” spawning new nodes or top-level Q’s if it’s a major domain.

Step 3: Consolidate & Generate
3.1. On-Demand Generation
* User Triggered
    * At any point, the user can click a “Generate Now” (or “Preview Mockup”) button to produce a partial or complete design.
    * No Formal End: There is no separate “end” to the Q&A phase; the user can continue answering more questions or revising old answers after generating if they wish.
* Filling Gaps
    * If some questions remain unanswered:
        * Trivial Unknowns (auto-mode) are guessed by the AI, labeled as “AI-guessed.”
        * Major Unknowns appear as placeholders or “TODO” notes in the requirements doc and code.
* Requirements Doc Preview
    * Right after generation, the system shows a requirements document (partial or complete), noting any unanswered or major unknown fields.
    * The user can download this doc (PDF, DOCX, Markdown) or simply preview it in-app.
* Prototype UI Code (React/Tailwind)
    * The AI produces a sandboxed React + Tailwind (or HTML/CSS) mockup that reflects all answered questions so far.
    * If large sections are unknown, code placeholders or “TODO” markers appear.
    * A “Copy Code” button is always available, plus “Export to Figma” for design iteration.
* Multiple Versions & Version Browsing
    * Each on-demand generation creates a new version stored in the system. The user can:
        * Preview any previously generated version,
        * Restore the Q&A tree to that version’s state,
        * Compare versions side by side.
3.2. Save for Later
* Session Preservation
    * The system can save the entire Q&A session—including prompt, answers, conflicts, design previews—under a named session.
* Local vs. Server
    * If user accounts exist (server-side), sessions can be shared or accessed across devices. Otherwise, localStorage (browser) is used.
* Metadata & Session Management
    * Each session has a timestamp, progress indicator, and optional custom name. A “My Sessions” screen lets users resume, rename, or delete sessions.
* Auto-Save & Manual Save
    * The system periodically auto-saves. A “Save” button also exists for manual checkpoints.
    * If the user tries to leave without saving, the system warns or auto-saves.

Interface Layout Summary
1. Main Canvas (Center)
    * Root Node (Prompt): “1000-floor elevator.”
    * Child Nodes (Q4, Q5, etc.): Appear under each parent upon completion.
    * Visual Indicators: Conflict icons for major issues, auto-fill icons for knowledge-base guesses.
2. Right-Hand Q&A Panel
    * Always open, showing the current question.
    * AI-generated prompts, conflicts/unknown alerts, resolution options.
    * “Auto-Populate” if knowledge-base data suggests an answer.
3. Header / Toolbar (Top)
    * Steps: (1) Setup, (2) Q&A, (3) Generate.
    * A progress bar (e.g., “X / Y answered”).
    * Knowledge Base status icon (uploaded or not).
4. Generation/Preview Area
    * A "Generate Mockup” button is consistently available
    * The user sees a Requirements Doc Preview and a React/Tailwind sandbox.
    * Tools for doc download, code copying, or exporting to design software.

Graph Impact Summary
1. Overridden Nodes & Children from Conflicts
    * Auto-resolve minor conflicts prunes or adjusts. Major conflicts prompt user choice.
2. Unknown Answers & Children
    * Auto-mode guesses trivial unknowns (“AI-guessed”).
    * Major unknowns block children until user input.
3. Editing a Parent Node & Branch Replacement
    * Changing a parent’s answer prunes invalid children and may spawn new ones.
4. Cross-Branch Conflicts
    * Minor → silent fix if enabled, major → user must reconcile.

Why This Flow Works

1. Prompt as Anchor
  * Keeps the user's main goal—designing a 1000-floor elevator—front and center.

2. Configurable Q&A Traversal
  * Breadth-First: Complete each level of questions before diving deeper
  * Depth-First: Fully explore each topic before moving to new ones
  * Lets users choose approach that matches their thinking style

3. **Sequential Question Generation
  * Only one question appears at a time
  * Each new question only shows after current one is answered
  * Prevents overwhelming the user with too many choices

4. Granular Unknown/Conflict Settings
  * Streamlined handling of minor gaps or mismatches
  * User-driven resolution for major decisions
  * Clear separation between AI-assisted and user-required choices

5. On-Demand Generation
  *The user can see a partial or complete design whenever they want, with guesses or placeholders for unanswered data.

6. Requirements & Live Prototype
  * Immediate generation of functional React/Tailwind concept
  * Direct translation of Q&A into working interface
  * Clear connection between requirements and implementation

7. Multiple Versions & Saved Sessions
  * Rapid iteration on different interface styles
  * Option to pause and resume at any time
  * Preserves exploration while allowing refinement

By making generation fully on-demand, users can produce and preview a design at any stage of Q&A. Unanswered data is filled in automatically (if minor) or flagged as incomplete. This approach preserves your BFS/DFS flow for question ordering, while granting users immediate partial prototypes and letting them iterate or revert to past versions as they refine the elevator interface’s requirements.
