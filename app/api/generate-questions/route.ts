/**
 * BFS_RULES and DFS_RULES are appended conditionally inside the system prompt.
 * The CRITICAL_RELEVANCE_RULE ensures that child questions quote the parentâ€™s answer.
 */

// BFS instructions
const BFS_RULES = `
BFS Guidelines:
          - CRITICAL: At Level 1 (top level), generate exactly 4-5 comprehensive questions that cover the main aspects.
          - For Level 2+, generate exactly 2-3 questions per parent aspect from the parent's answer.
          - Each sibling at the same level MUST focus on a different aspect from the parent's answer.
          - CRITICAL: ALL Level 2 children of ALL Level 1 questions must be generated before ANY Level 3 questions.
          - Example progression:
            Parent Q1: "What are the core user flows and functional requirements?"
            Parent A1: "The interface should offer search, filtering, and zoom levels..."
            Valid Child Q5: "What specific search capabilities should be implemented?"
            Valid Child Q6: "What filtering options should be available to users?"
            Valid Child Q7: "How should the zoom level functionality work?"
      
          Level Structure and Progression:
          - Level 1 (exactly 4-5 questions): Core requirements and fundamental aspects.
            Example: "What are the core user flows?", "What accessibility features are needed?"
      
          - Level 2 (exactly 2-3 questions per parent aspect): Direct exploration of parent aspects.
            Example: If Level 1 answer mentions "search, filtering, and zoom":
            * Q5-Q7 explores search aspects.
            * Q8-Q10 explores filtering aspects.
            * Q11-Q13 explores zoom aspects.
            CRITICAL: Generate Level 2 questions for ALL Level 1 answers before moving to Level 3.
      
          - Level 3+ (exactly 2-3 questions per parent aspect): Implementation details.
            Example: If Level 2 answer about search mentions "real-time search and filters":
            * "How should real-time search results be displayed?"
            * "What search result filtering options are needed?"
            * "What performance requirements for search response time?"
      
          Aspect Coverage Rules:
          1. Each child question MUST:
             * Directly reference a specific aspect from parent's answer using exact terminology.
             * Maintain clear topic lineage from Level 1 through current level.
             * Ask for more specific details about that aspect.
      
          2. Sibling questions MUST:
             * Each focus on a different aspect from parent's answer.
             * Not overlap in their focus areas.
             * Together cover all major aspects mentioned in parent's answer.
             * Stay at the same depth level as each other.
      
          3. Moving Deeper Rules:
             * NEVER generate Level 3 questions until ALL Level 2 questions for ALL Level 1 parents are complete.
             * Each deeper question must make the parent aspect more specific.
             * Maintain clear topic lineage by referencing both direct parent and Level 1 ancestor.
      
          Cycling Behavior:
          1. When a branch is fully explored:
             * First complete all siblings at current level.
             * Only move deeper when ALL nodes at current level across ALL branches are complete.
             * If all branches are explored, return to Level 1 with new aspects.
      
          2. When generating new Level 1 questions after a cycle:
             * Must cover completely different aspects than ALL previous Level 1 questions.
             * Should maintain the same level of importance as original Level 1 questions.
      
          Progression Rules:
          1. After getting exactly 4-5 Level 1 questions answered:
             * Generate Level 2 questions for EACH answered Level 1 question.
             * Only add new Level 1 questions if starting a new cycle.
      
          2. When to move deeper:
             * ALL questions at current level are answered.
             * EACH parent has exactly 2-3 child questions.
             * ALL aspects from ALL parent answers are covered.
      
          3. When to stay at current level:
             * ANY aspects from ANY parent answer are still unexplored.
             * ANY parent has fewer than 2 child questions.
   * ANY questions at current level are unanswered.

// DFS instructions
const DFS_RULES = `
DFS Guidelines:
          - CRITICAL: In DFS mode, fully explore ONE topic branch before moving to siblings.
          - Maximum depth is 5 levels, but can be less if topics are fully explored.
          - When all branches are exhausted, return to Level 1 with new aspects.
      
          Sibling Count Guidelines:
          - Level 1: Exactly 4-5 main topic questions.
          - Level 2-5: Exactly 2-3 questions per parent aspect.
      
          Example proper DFS progression:
          Q1: "What are the core navigation features needed?"
          Parent A1: "Need a main menu, search bar, and user profile section."
      
          First Branch (Main Menu) - Complete this ENTIRE branch before siblings:
          Q2: "What specific items should be in the main menu?"
          A2: "Home, Products, Categories, Cart, and User Profile links."
          Q3: "How should the menu items be organized?"
          A3: "Primary items visible, secondary in dropdown."
          Q4: "What interactions should menu items have?"
          A4: "Hover previews and dropdown menus."
          [MUST complete ALL menu questions before moving to search]
      
          Second Branch (Search) - Only start after menu is complete:
          Q5: "What search functionality is required?"
          A5: "Real-time search with filters and suggestions."
          Q6: "How should search results be displayed?"
          A6: "Grid layout with quick preview cards."
          Q7: "What advanced search options are needed?"
          A7: "Category filters and price range selectors."
          [MUST complete ALL search questions before user profile]
      
          Third Branch (User Profile) - Only start after search is complete:
          Q8: "What user profile information should be shown?"
          Q9: "What profile customization options are needed?"
      
          Topic Exploration Rules:
          1. Each branch MUST:
             * Start with broad feature questions.
             * Progress to specific implementation details.
             * End with edge cases and optimizations.
             * Maintain clear topic lineage throughout.
      
          2. Question Depth Requirements:
             * Level 1: Broad feature questions (exactly 4-5)
             * Level 2: Feature breakdown (exactly 2-3 per feature)
             * Level 3: Technical implementation details (exactly 2-3 per Level 2 answer)
             * Level 4: Edge cases (exactly 2-3 per Level 3 answer)
             * Level 5: Optimizations (exactly 2-3 per Level 4 answer)
      
          Branch Completion Rules:
          1. A branch is ONLY complete when:
             - ALL aspects of the current topic are fully explored.
             - Questions have reached implementation-level detail.
             - Edge cases and optimizations are addressed.
             - Reached maximum depth (5 levels) OR
             - ALL possible questions about the topic are answered.
      
          2. When to stop current branch (shouldStopBranch=true):
             - Reached maximum depth (5 levels) OR
             - ALL aspects from parent's answer are fully explored AND
             - Questions would become too specific to be useful OR
             - Current topic is fully defined with implementation details.
      
          3. When to move to siblings:
             - ONLY after current branch is FULLY explored.
             - When shouldStopBranch=true is returned AND
             - No more meaningful child questions can be generated.
             - NEVER move to siblings until current topic is complete.
      
          4. Question Depth Progression:
             Level 1: High-level feature questions (exactly 4-5).
             Level 2: Specific requirements (exactly 2-3 per parent).
             Level 3: Technical implementation details (exactly 2-3 per parent).
             Level 4: Edge case handling (exactly 2-3 per parent).
             Level 5: Performance optimization (exactly 2-3 per parent).
      
          Topic Lineage Rules:
          1. Each question MUST:
             * Directly reference its parent topic.
             * Use exact terminology from parent's answer.
             * Maintain clear connection to Level 1 ancestor.
             * Progress logically deeper into the topic.
      
          2. Moving Between Siblings:
             * NEVER move to a sibling until current branch is complete.
             * Each sibling must explore a different main topic.
             * Siblings must be at the same depth level.
             * Complete ALL aspects of current topic before moving.
      
          3. Starting New Level 1 Questions:
             * Only after ALL current Level 1 branches are complete.
             * Must cover completely different aspects than ALL previous Level 1 questions.
             * Maintain same level of importance as original Level 1s.
      
          Question Generation Rules:
          1. Each new question MUST:
             * Be more specific than its parent.
             * Focus on unexplored aspects of parent's answer.
             * Maintain clear topic focus.
             * Progress logically deeper into implementation.
      
          2. Depth Requirements:
             * Level 1: Core feature identification.
             * Level 2: Feature requirement specification.
             * Level 3: Technical implementation details.
             * Level 4: Edge case handling.
             * Level 5: Performance optimization.
      
          3. When generating questions:
             * Use exact terminology from parent's answer.
             * Focus on one specific aspect at a time.
             * Ensure logical progression of detail.
   * Maintain clear topic boundaries.

// Shared CRITICAL RELEVANCE RULE - applies to both BFS & DFS:
const CRITICAL_RELEVANCE_RULE = `
CRITICAL RELEVANCE RULE:
1. The new question MUST explicitly quote at least one exact phrase from the parent's answer in quotes 
   (e.g., "voice-activated controls" or "categorized floor directory").
2. The new question MUST demand deeper detail or specific implementation guidelines for that phrase.
3. If the parentâ€™s answer already covers that phrase fully, the new question must explore edge cases, advanced features, or constraints related to it.
4. The new question must NOT be fully answerable by the parent's answer alone; it must prompt for additional clarifications or deeper specifics.
5. Failure to quote the parent's exact phrase is not permitted for the new child question.
6. The new question MUST explicitly reference both the parent's question and its answer (for example, by quoting key parts of each).
7. Use the parent's question and answer as anchors to drive the follow-up inquiry.

Follow these guidelines:
1. Question Progression Levels:
   Current Depth: ${depth}/5

   BFS Mode Levels:
   - Level 1 (Basic Needs): Broad, fundamental questions about purpose, audience, and core requirements
   - Level 2 (Features): Main sections and key features
   - Level 3 (Details): Specific details about each feature or section
   - Level 4 (Refinements): Technical specs and implementation details
   - Level 5 (Polish): Edge cases, final refinements

2. Child Question Generation Rules:
   - Child questions MUST be more specific than their parent question.
   - Child questions MUST explore a specific aspect mentioned in the parent's answer.
   - NEVER ask the same question as the parent with slightly different wording.

3. Traversal Rules (${traversalMode}):
${traversalMode === 'bfs' ? BFS_RULES : DFS_RULES}
      
      4. Topic Management:
   - BFS: Generate siblings for each aspect first
   - DFS: Explore one aspect deeply before siblings
      
      5. Question Generation:
         - Generate exactly ONE question.
   - For BFS: Return shouldStopBranch=true if no unexplored aspects remain
   - For DFS: Return shouldStopBranch=true when the aspect is fully explored
      
      6. Stopping Criteria:
   - Topic fully explored, or the knowledge base is sufficient.

      CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
      1. Review ALL previous questions and their topics carefully.
      2. Generate ONE question that explores a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT aspect not covered in ANY previous question.
3. If BFS, ensure the new question:
   - Stays at the current level
   - Covers a new topic not yet discussed
   - Follows the BFS rules
4. If DFS, continue deeper on the current aspect until fully explored
5. Provide a suggestedAnswer following the guidelines

Topics already covered (DO NOT repeat these or related topics):
      ${previousQuestions
        .map((q: { question: string }, index: number) => `${index + 1}. ${q.question}`)
        .join('\n')}
      
      Remember:
- No second-person pronouns
- No repeating or rephrasing parent's question
- BFS covers all aspects at a level; DFS goes deeper on one aspect.`;
